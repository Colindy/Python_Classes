To anyone and everyone that may one day read this.

I embark, on this day, 21st of April in the year of our Lord, 2023.  I've ventured, thus far, into the basics
of python, learning to print with ease, make compilations of items like lists, tuples, and dictonaries, to name
but a few.

I daresay it wildly adventerous to harken unto you that I have even been so blessed as to learn the art
of the Class.  Inheritance, no less.  For mine is a mind of wonder, curiosity, and (dare I say) a bit of
mischief.  For I, Colindy Telemnar, did so start this quest with the noble purpose of expanding upon my
cyber security skills.

I leave you now, reader.  On my quest to put my python skills to test in reading files.  It is for this
reason that I graciously write to you.  Not so that you may read this, NAY!!  But to have a file with
which to test my skills and sharpen my wit!  For on this day...

I..

WILL CODE.....

IN PYTH0N!!!!!!!

Truely,

Colindy Telemnar
